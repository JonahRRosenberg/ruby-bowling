THE GAME OF BOWLING
===================

#Progress of Play
A game is made up of 10 frames. Each frame represents one turn for the bowler, and in each turn the player is allowed to roll the ball twice. If the player knocks down all the pins with the first roll, it is a strike; if not, a second roll at the pins still standing is attempted. If all the pins are knocked down with two balls, it is a spare; if any pins are left standing, it is an "open frame."


If a bowler commits a foul, by stepping over the foul line during delivery, it counts as a shot, and any pins knocked down are re-spotted without counting. If pins are knocked down by a ball that has entered the gutter, or by a ball bouncing off the rear cushion, they do not count, and are re-spotted.

#Scoring
##Frame
There are ten frames in one game. You have two chances to knock down the ten pins in each frame (see the
explanations for strike and spare). Note that the tenth frame rewards you with a final bonus ball if you convert your spare (or make two strikes). You can thus throw nine strikes in the first nine frames and, if you get another two in the tenth, the bonus ball means the most strikes you can have in one game is twelve. This is called a perfect game..
##Spare
Getting all ten pins down with one ball is not as easy as it seems! So, if you leave one or more pins standing after your first delivery, you get a second chance to knock all the pins down, this is your "spare" shot. If you knock all remaining pins down on the second shot you have made your spare. A spare is marked on the scoresheet with a "/". It takes skill to consistently make spares and the scoring system rewards you by adding in the pins from the next ball into the current frame. See also split.
##Strike
When the bowler knocks down all ten pins with the first delivery of the ball it is called a strike. Clearly your score goes up by ten, but like a spare, you get a bonus - your next two deliveries are added to the score. Stringing strikes together will raise your score dramatically (See turkey). Marked on the scoresheet with an "X".
##Open Frame
If you fail to make your spare, i.e. knock all pins down in two shots it is called an open frame.

Consistently making all your spares will give you an average in the 180 to 190 range. When you develop your game so that you can start to string strikes together your score will go up and you will start to approach the 200 or 210 mark, which many have likened to being a "scratch" golfer.

#Please Score these by hand

##EXAMPLE 1

|￼Frame | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
|:------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Mike  | 9-0 | 3-5 | 6-1 | 3-6 | 8-1 | 5-3 | 2-5 | 8-0 | 7-1 | 8-1 |
| Score |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

In Example 1 we omitted strikes and spares for simplicity. Each frame is totaled and added to the cumulative score.

##EXAMPLE 2
|￼Frame | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
|:------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Mike  | 9-0 | 3-/ | 6-1 | 3-/ | 8-1 | 5-/ | 0-/ | 8-0 | 7-/ | 8-1 |
| Score |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

In Example 2 we learn how to score spares and open frames together. A spare is scored as 10, plus the pinfall of the next ball rolled. This total is added to the cumulative score.

##EXAMPLE 3
|￼Frame | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10    |
|:------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Mike  | X   | 3-/ | 6-1 | X   | X   | X   | 2-/ | 9-0 | 7-/ | X-X-X |
| Score |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |       |

In Example 1 we omitted strikes and spares for simplicity. Each frame is totaled and added to the cumulative score.

##EXAMPLE 2
|￼Frame | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |

In Example 2 we learn how to score spares and open frames together. A spare is scored as 10, plus the pinfall of the next ball rolled. This total is added to the cumulative score.

- Frame 1) Count 9 pins
- Frame 2) Spare (10), plus next ball (6) added to score = 25
- Frame 3) Count 7 pins and add to score = 32
- Frame 4) Spare (10), plus next ball (8) added to score = 50
- Frame 5) Count 9 pins and add to score = 59
- Frame 6) Spare (10), plus next ball (0) added to score = 69
- Frame 7) Spare (10), plus next ball (8) added to score = 87
- Frame 8) Count 8 pins and add to score = 95
- Frame 9) Spare (10), plus next ball (8) added to score = 113
- Frame 10) Add 9 to score = 122

##EXAMPLE 3
|￼Frame | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10    |
|:------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Mike  | X   | 3-/ | 6-1 | X   | X   | X   | 2-/ | 9-0 | 7-/ | X-X-X |
| Score | 20  | 36  | 43  | 73  | 95  | 115 | 134 | 143 | 163 | 193   |

In Example 3 we learn how to score strikes, spares, and open frames together. A strike is scored as 10, plus the pinfall of the next 2 balls rolled. A spare is scored as 10, plus the pinfall of the next ball rolled. This total is added to the cumulative score. We also learn that when we score the final frame, any spare or strike in the frame adds the number of rolls necessary score it.

- Frame 1) Strike (10), plus next 2 balls (3)(7) = 20
- Frame 2) Spare (10), plus next ball (6) added to score = 36
- Frame 3) Count 7 pins and add to score = 43
- Frame 4) Strike (10), plus next 2 balls (10)(10) add to score = 73
- Frame 5) Strike (10), plus next 2 balls (10)(2) add to score = 95
- Frame 6) Strike (10), plus next 2 balls (2)(8) add to score = 115
- Frame 7) Spare (10), plus next ball (9) added to score = 134
- Frame 8) Count 9 pins and add to score = 143
- Frame 9) Spare (10), plus next ball (10) added to score = 163 
- Frame 10) Strike (10), Strike (10), Strike (10) = 193
